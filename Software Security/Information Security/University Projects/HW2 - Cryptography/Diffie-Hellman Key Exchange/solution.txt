## Secret code

3776f87e-699572e3

## Explanation

First, a private key x is generated by the client, using the given EC_CURVE. g^x is then found by taking the public key of x. The bytes of g^x are then sent to the server using the provided API, and g^y bytes are received back from the server (after some parsing). g^xy is then found by calling exchange() on the original private key x, with the g^y received from the server passed as an argument. g^xy is then passed to the given code and the secret code is calculated.
