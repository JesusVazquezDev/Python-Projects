# Python-Projects

#### Much of what is available at time of writing does not have README.md files. I intend on making this repo much more elegant however, academics are taking up a good amount of my time at the moment. Once I graduate, I'll revamp this repo.

#### Disclaimer: Students should not use any of the code in the repo as their own. If you do, you will face disciplinary action via the University. Just don't do it.
